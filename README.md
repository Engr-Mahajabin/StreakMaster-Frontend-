# 🌱 StreakMaster — From Notes to Growth

**Your personal growth mentor, built from scratch.**

Every day, I write notes about what I learn — tiny wins, unfinished tasks, random thoughts.  
But those notes never told me **how far I’ve really come**, or **what I should focus on next**.

Even in 2025, there wasn’t any system that truly felt *personal* — something that could track my progress, motivate me, and guide me like a real mentor.  
So I decided to take it personally — and build one myself. 💡
